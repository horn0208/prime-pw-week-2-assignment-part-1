    <!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <p>Is it ok if we use things in our code that haven't been covered in the videos?
       For example, since we're concatenating strings a bunch this week, could we use template literals? Or just stick to the basics?
    </p>
    <p>What's your stance on using == ? 
      I've heard it can behave in a shady sometimes unpredictable way, and a book I'm reading (Javascript: The good parts) recommends avoiding it whenever possible. What do you think? Is there a situation where we'd want to use == instead of === that wouldn't potentially get us into trouble?</p>
